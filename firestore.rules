/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for BonwireKente e-commerce platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data and allows public read access to product information.
 * Write access to user data is restricted to the authenticated user. Data validation is minimal to allow for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: Publicly readable product information.
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile data, accessible only to the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/cart: User's cart, accessible only to the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/cart/cartItems/{cartItemId}: Items in the user's cart, accessible only to the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}: User's orders, accessible only to the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Items within a specific order, accessible only to the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/wishlist: User's wishlist, accessible only to the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Products are publicly readable but only writeable by authenticated users (admins).
 * - Users can only access their own profile data, cart, orders, and wishlist.
 * - No user listing is allowed to protect user privacy.
 * - A collection group query on 'orders' is allowed for admins to view all orders.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The data model is designed to avoid `get()` calls in security rules by nesting user-specific data under the `/users/{userId}` path.
 *  - The `userId` is used in the path to ensure that only the authenticated user can access their own data.
